On June 2019, I graduated with a Computer Science degree from UC Santa Cruz.
I didn't have a job lined up, so I went back home and started applying.
I wouldn't consider my path to be traditional one, but I did learn somethings along the way that I'd like to share.

## Working while job hunting

Within a couple weeks after graduation, I started working in construction. Before I started working, my boss knew that I was a recent grad and was looking for a job in tech. He was okay with it, and simply asked me to
give him a notice when I was ready to move on.

In construction, I usually worked 8-10 hours a day.
Once I was off work, I would spend my evenings doing coding challenges,
practicing interviews, and applying to software engineering jobs.

I did this for a few months, till an opportunity came up for me.
60 applications later, and with the help of friends and mentors, 
I got an interview at Accenture.

### Accenture

My introduction to <a href="http://accenture.com/" target="_blank">Accenture</a>
 was through a refferal from a friend. I first spoke to him about my career goals, and he told me about his experience at Accenture and what they do. I could see myself growing at Accenture, and I liked the work culture he described. It was also a good match for me because I enjoy working people and tech. In consulting, I'm able to do both.

During my interview process with Accenture, a couple of my friends help me with inteview tips and advice. But in order to get my foot in the door, I needed to put in the work myself.

I had calls with recruiters first, then managers.
I spent hours a day prepping for each interview.
The first one was less formal and more about getting to know me.
The second, was about my career interests and how I see myself fitting in at Accenture.
For my third interview, I practiced the <a href="https://www.indeed.com/hire/c/info/star-interview-format?aceid=&gclid=Cj0KCQiAk53-BRD0ARIsAJuNhpvDgIFRH5Yjo65ZW91BZkn5X5RAhOV7tPAJk8IBpIzF1yC6AjNJmZoaAhSdEALw_wcB" target="_blank">STAR Method</a>.
The fourth and final interview was a <a href='https://biginterview.com/case-interview-questions/' target='_blank'>Case interview</a>.

Consulting companies, like Accenture, do case interviews. They do this as a way to see how you would
handle a business scenario for a client. There is no right or wrong answer,
but you should employ problem solving and customer service. What I mean by this is, show the interviewer
that you are able to analyze the situation, come up with some suggestions for the client, and communicate your ideas.
To study for this interview I read articles, watched <a href='https://www.youtube.com/user/caseinterview' target='_blank'>youtube videos</a>, and practiced by myself and with others.

There a couple other things that helped me during the interview process. Because I was applying to a technical role, I talked about my short internship with a software startup. I also have experience working in restuarants and retail stores where I learned about the importance of customer service. Despite it being a different industry, we still strive to deliver the most value to the customer/client and making them happy.

> When I think of my time in construction and hospitality, I wouldn't want it be any other way. I see every job I've had, technical or not, white or blue collar, as an opportunity to learn.
