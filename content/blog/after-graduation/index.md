On June 2019, I graduated with a Computer Science degree from UC Santa Cruz.
At the time, I did not have a job lined up. I went back home and started applying.
I wouldn't consider my path to be traditional one, but I did learn somethings along the way that I'd like to share.

## Working while job hunting

Within a couple weeks after I graduated, I started working in construction.
On my first day, I told my boss that I had just graduated and I was looking for
a job in tech. He was okay with it, and simply asked me to
give him a notice when I do find a job in my field.

In construction, I usually worked 8-10 hours a day.
Once I was off work, I would spend my evenings doing coding challenges,
interview practice, and applying to software engineering jobs.

I did this for a few months, till an opportunity came up for me.
60 applications later, and with the help of friends and mentors, 
I got interviews at Accenture.

### Accenture

My introduction to <a href="http://accenture.com/" target="_blank">Accenture</a>
 was through a friend who reffered me. I first spoke to him about my career goals, and he told me about his experience at Accenture and what they do. I knew that tech and consulting was where I wanted to be. My friend referred me to the Technology Development Program.

During my interview process with Accenture, there were two main friends who helped with interview advice and practice. But in order to get my foot in the door, I needed to put in the work myself.

I had calls with recruiters first, then managers.
I spent hours a day prepping for each interview.
The first one was less formal and more about getting to know me.
The second, was about my career interests and how I see myself fitting in at Accenture.
For my third interview, I practiced the <a href="https://www.indeed.com/hire/c/info/star-interview-format?aceid=&gclid=Cj0KCQiAk53-BRD0ARIsAJuNhpvDgIFRH5Yjo65ZW91BZkn5X5RAhOV7tPAJk8IBpIzF1yC6AjNJmZoaAhSdEALw_wcB" target="_blank">STAR Method</a>.
The fourth and final interview was a <a href='https://biginterview.com/case-interview-questions/' target='_blank'>Case interview</a>.

Consulting companies, like Accenture, do case interviews. They do this as a way to see how you would
handle a business scenario for a client. There is no right or wrong answer,
but you should employ problem solving and customer service. What I mean by this is, show the interviewer
that you are able to analyze the situation, come up with some suggestions for the client, and communicate your ideas.

To study for this interview I read articles, watched <a href='https://www.youtube.com/user/caseinterview' target='_blank'>youtube videos</a>, and practiced by myself and with others.

> When I think of my time in construction, I wouldn't want it be any other way. I see every job I've had, technical or not, white or blue collar, as an opportunity to learn.

### Summary

When applying to a company, do your homework, and make sure that its a place where you'd like to work.
In my case, Accenture was where I wanted to be because I am passionate about using my skills to help others.
Here, I am able to combine my interest in tech and building relationships with clients by helping them grow their business.

One thing I would recommend is do internships before you graduate. They will help you stand out in the interview process and can give you an edge. If you don't have any by the time you graduate, don't panic. Lean on your experiences of working with others in class projects or any part time job that you've had.
