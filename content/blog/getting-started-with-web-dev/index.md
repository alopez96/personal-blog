### Who This Article is For
If you’re ready to code your first website, this post is for you.
In this post, I will focus on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I will talk about what they are used for and why you need them. I will go into Static vs Dynamic sites. I will also highlight good resources to learn with (both free and paid).

### What This Article Isn't
I will not go into coding an example or project. To get experience, it's best to practice the ideas I will cover here. To get something hands on, you could follow an online course or going through a YouTube series.


### My Advice on Development
If you want to get into web develompent, I'd recommend starting with learning the fundamentals of each language and what it's used for. Don't try to remember everything because there's too much and it's not worth it. You could just look it up something specific next time you need it.

Now, let's dive into what you need to get started with coding a website.

### HTML & CSS

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and it's  a markup language for websites. It is like the structure and foundation of a home. In it’s bare form, it works but it doesn’t look good. If you look at a website that only has HTML, you will just read text, links, images. But nothing will be styled or formatted.

To add some color (no pun intended) to your site, you will need CSS. With it, you can transform your site to make it look aesthetically pleasing by defining the font, size, width, padding, color, spacing, shadow, and much more of each element.

HTML and CSS can take you pretty far. But your site will limit out as a static website.

### Static vs Dynamic

Static means that your site has fixed content that it and will display the same information to all users. It’s a good place to host information, content and links to other pages. For a lot of sites, this is all you need. But as soon you need to handle transactions and do more than just display content on the screen, then your site will need to be dynamic. 

This is where JavaScript (JS) comes in. JS is a programming language, and with it you can define classes, objects, functions, loops, data structures, and create algorithms. With this logic, you could do things in the background, and even program to change or update something on the screen. In Frontend Development, it is used to change the way something is displayed or shown to the user. In Backend Development, it is used to write server logic and connect to databases.
For example, if your website needs to have users login, create an account, or purchase something, then you will need a dynamic site.

### Final Comments

This is an introduction about what you would need to code a website. Just to recap, you could use HTML and CSS to generate a static site. To add more functionality, you will need a programming language like JavaScript.

To get started, you can learn and practice for free on <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/'>W3 schools</a>, <a href='https://www.freecodecamp.org/'>Free Code Camp</a>, and <a href='https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css'>Khan Academy</a>.
For a paid option, I recommend <a href='https://zerotomastery.io/'>Zero To Mastery</a> by Andrei. He has really good programming courses that can take you from beginner to advanced.
