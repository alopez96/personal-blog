description: Life after college as a Computer Science student.
---

On June 2019, I graduated with a Computer Science degree from UC Santa Cruz.
At the time, I did not have a job lined up. I went back home and started applying to jobs.

## Working while job hunting

Within a couple weeks after I graduated, I started working in construction.
On my first day, I told my boss that I had just graduated and I was looking for
a job in tech. He was okay with it, and simply requested that I
give him a notice of when I do find a job in my field.

In construction, I usually worked 8-10 hours a day.
Once I was off work, I would spend my evenings doing coding challenges,
interview practice, and applying to software engineering jobs.

I did this for a few months, till an opportunity came up for me.
60+ applications later, and with the help of friends and mentors, 
I got an interview at two companies.

### Accenture

A friend, who I look up to, put me in contact with her connection at 
[Accenture](http://accenture.com). This connection at Accenture, was someone who I had once met
at a [SHPE](https://www.shpe.org/) event while I was in college. But I had not been in contact till my
friend reconnected me with me.
 When I spoke to him, I told him about
my story and interests. I wanted him to see that I could be a good candidate as a referral. 
He then I agreed to reffer me to Accenture.

Both these two friends gave me tips on the interviews and they were a big support along the way.
But in order to get my foot in the door, I needed to put in the work myself.

For Accenture, I had 2 calls with recruiters, and 2 calls with Managers.
I spent hours a day prepping for each interview.
The first one was less formal and more about getting to know me.
The second, was about my career interests and how I see myself fitting in at Accenture.
For my third interview, I practiced the [STAR Method](https://www.indeed.com/hire/c/info/star-interview-format?aceid=&gclid=Cj0KCQiAk53-BRD0ARIsAJuNhpvDgIFRH5Yjo65ZW91BZkn5X5RAhOV7tPAJk8IBpIzF1yC6AjNJmZoaAhSdEALw_wcB).
The final interview, was a [case interview](https://biginterview.com/case-interview-questions/).

Case interviews are done by consulting companies. It is pretty much a way to see how you would
handle a business scenario for the client. There is no right or wrong answer,
but you should employ problem solving and customer service. What I mean by this is, show the interviewer
that you are able to analyze the situation, come up with some suggestions for the client, and communicate your ideas.

To study for this interview I read articles, watched [youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/caseinterview), and practiced by myself and with others.


### Apple

I applied online to
[Apple's Orchard program](https://9to5mac.com/2016/10/05/apple-orchard-program-marketing-talent/).
When I applied here, I did not think I was going to 
think I would get a callback.
But this is a good example of where you should take your shot, even if you aren't sure it will go in.

With Apple, I made it to the final round of interviews, where they invited me to Cuppertino. The position was to join the marketing team as a front end developer.
That day, I had 4 interviews back-to-back. Although I did not get the offer, it was a good experience.

> When I think of my time in construction, I wouldn't want it be any other way. I see every job I've had, technical or not, white or blue collar, as an opportunity to learn.

### Summary

When applying to a company, do your homework, and make sure that its a place where you'd like to work.
In my case, Accenture was where I wanted to be because I am passionate about using my skills to help clients.
Here, I am able to combine my interest in tech with building relationships with clients and helping their business grow.
That is the same reason why I do my web consulting on the side.

For anyone that I have reffered to Accenture, I always talk to them about what we do.
This is not a typical software company, we doing consulting and have clients in many different industries.
